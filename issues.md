Solved(ish): Ran into lots of problems tonight moving forward in tutorial. Moving code from mainJS.js to '<script></script>' inside body tag like in kittyattack tutorial seems to make things happy. Probably a very easy way to move this back into mainJS and call it in the body.
    Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()
    Images wont load on deployed GH pages page. Probably need to move them to public\images\image.png instead of images\image.png.


Http-server: 
index.html updates changes when page is refreshed, but everything else does not. To update any other code you have to clear cache/cookies before refresh for it to function properly. Super frustrating!
